## Welcome! 👋
My name is <strong>Rebecca L. Smith</strong>, I'm currently attending California Polytechnic State University Pomona and I'm majoring in Computer Science. My professional journey began as a self-taught graphic designer, where I developed skills in both design and web development. While working and attending college, I also balanced the responsibilities of being a full-time parent. Over time, my career focus changed from graphic design to software development. This was mostly driven by my passion for transforming ideas into tangible, more impactful creations. Today, my primary professional aspiration is to advance my skills in software development.
