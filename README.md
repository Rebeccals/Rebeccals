## Welcome! 👋
My name is <strong>Rebecca L. Smith</strong>, I'm currently attending California Polytechnic State University Pomona and I'm majoring in Computer Science. I started out as a self-taught Graphic Designer. While doing Graphic Design part-time, I was also a full-time stay at home mom. I've designed and coded several websites on the side through out the years, but never made it a career. Several years later, I switched paths because my passion for art is better spent as a hobby. My love for software development has since grown and it has now become my second passion.
