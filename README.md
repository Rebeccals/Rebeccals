## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹
My name is Rebecca, I'm currently attending California Polytechnic State University Pomona and I'm majoring in Computer Science. I started out as a self-taught Graphic Designer, but realized later on that my passion for art is better spent as a hobby instead of a career. While doing part-time graphic design work, I was also a full-time stay at home mom. I've coded and developed several websites on the side. However, I never thought I was good enough to be a software developer. Flash forward to today and I'm now well on my way to completing my bachelors in Computer Science. Expect more applications and projects in the future (when time allows)...
