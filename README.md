## Welcome! 👋
My name is <strong>Rebecca L. Smith</strong>, I'm currently attending California Polytechnic State University Pomona and I'm majoring in Computer Science. My professional journey began as a self-taught graphic designer, where I gained valuable experience in both design and web development. Along the way, I balanced work, college and the responsibilities of being a full-time parent. Over time, my career evolved as I discovered that my passion for transforming ideas into something more meaningful was better realized through software development. Moving forward, my main focus will be dedicating myself fully to growing my skills and knowledge in software development.
